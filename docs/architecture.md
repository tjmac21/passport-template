# Architecture and Design

Passport-Template follows a client-server architecture, with a React front-end communicating with a Node.js/Express back-end via a RESTful API. The back-end interacts with a PostgreSQL database using Supabase.

## System Components

### Front-end (React)

- **Pages**: The main pages of the application, such as Home, Explore, Profile, etc.
- **Components**: Reusable UI components, such as SessionBrief, Loading, etc.
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects, such as useAuth, useCompany, etc.

### Back-end (Node.js/Express)

- **Routes**: Express routes that define the API endpoints and handle incoming requests.
- **Controllers**: Functions that contain the business logic for each API endpoint.
- **Models**: Data models that define the structure of the data in the database.
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

### Database (PostgreSQL)

- **Tables**: The main entities in the system, such as users, sessions, companies, etc.
- **Relationships**: The associations between entities, such as a session belonging to a company.

## Data Flow

1. The user interacts with the React UI, which dispatches actions to update the application state.
2. When data needs to be retrieved or updated, the React components call the appropriate service module.
3. The service modules make HTTP requests to the Express API endpoints.
4. The Express routes receive the requests and call the appropriate controller functions.
5. The controller functions interact with the database using Supabase's API to retrieve or update data.
6. The controllers send responses back to the React front-end, which updates the UI with the new data.

## Key Design Decisions

- **React Hooks**: We use React hooks extensively to manage state and side effects in a functional component-based architecture. This makes the code more reusable and easier to reason about.
- **Supabase**: We use Supabase as a backend-as-a-service to simplify our database and authentication management. This allows us to focus on the core application logic.
- **RESTful API**: We follow REST principles in designing our API, with clear separation of concerns between the front-end and back-end. This makes the system more modular and maintainable.
